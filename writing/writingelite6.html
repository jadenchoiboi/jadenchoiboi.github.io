            Dr. Willner looked at him with hate. “It’s the school’s decision.”(182). In the novel “After” by Francine
            Prose,
            the parents and the parenting that goes on is surprisingly horrible. A school shooting has occurred and now
            the
            parents are trusting Dr. Willner, Central High’s Grief Counselor more than their own children, Silas, Avery,
            Brian, and Tom. In the novel “After”, parents are trusting Dr. Willner more than their own children, and
            this is
            a big mistake for the parents to be doing, since the children are the ones that know why Dr. Willner is
            there,
            and what his main goal is.
        </p>
        <p>
            The first example of bad parenting is found when Dr. Willner sends Silas and Avery away to Operation
            Turnaround,
            and the parents of these children don’t even care what they say; they just trust Dr. Willner and they do
            whatever he says. My dad said “What’s wrong with Silas’s parents? Have they lost their minds? Imagine them
            agreeing to let their kid go off to one of those hell-holes! That poor kid! No wonder he’s got a drug
            problem!...” (pg. ). Even Tom’s dad thinks that Silas’s parents are out of their mind. Silas does everything
            he
            can to stop his parents from agreeing to send them to Operation Turnaround. He tells them the truth; why Dr.
            Willner is here and all of what he knows about what is happening, but his parents are just acting like
            robots.
            They are doing what Dr. Willner says. Silas’s parents don’t have enough trust in their child, and according
            to
            research done at Princeton University, parents don’t trust the children enough, which led to the child being
            defiance, aggressiveness, and hyperactive when they were adults.

        <p>
            The second case of bad parenting is shown when Silas is smoking marijuana, but his parents don’t know, or
            they
            just don’t care. Silas is a drug user, and his main problem is that he doesn’t know how to stop it. He gets
            busted in school for using it, and the drug test for the sport’s team shows that Silas uses drugs. Marijuana
            can
            stay in your blood for many years, and also has effects on the body, such as burning your mouth and throat,
            red
            eyes, getting black lung, etc. Smoking as a young age like Silas is bad, but the parents do nothing about
            it. An
            average parent would make sure that their children stop using or doing drugs, but Silas’s parents are the
            opposite of that. If they knew about Silas’s drug addict, they should at least tried to stop it, but the
            parents
            act like nothing bad happened, and it isn’t a big deal whether Silas smokes or not. (pg. 157) Coach Pete
            said,
            “Let’s bag practice for this afternoon. See you guys tomorrow, same time, same place. Silas and I have some
            business I guess we need to take care of.” Coach Pete is supposed to do drug tests, and Silas gets busted
            taking
            drugs, even though Coach Pete gave him a whole week to try to stop taking drugs. This shows that Silas’s
            parents
            are very careless of what their son does.

            Finally, there are problems of bad parenting with Tom’s Dad and Clara. They trust Tom more than Dr. Willner
            and
            both are against what Dr. Willner is doing and the emails he is sending. (pg. 211) “What could be worse?”
            asked
            my dad. “Tom, what’s going on at that place?” Tom’s dad and Clara care about what Tom says and believes that
            people are being sent away and Dr. Willner is doing weird things to send everyone to Operation Turnaround.
            Meanwhile, there is some bad parenting examples with Tom’s dad and Clara also. They know exactly what’s
            going
            on, but don’t do anything against it. A good parent would talk to their friends and start a protest team
            against
            Dr. Willner or something similar to that, but Tom’s dad and Clara don’t do anything. (pg. 313) “We’ll figure
            something out,” said my dad. “You are definitely not going to be sent away to some detention camp.” Tom’s
            dad
            says these things, but doesn’t do anything about it until the end, where Tom, Tom’s Dad, and Clara go to
            Pleasant Valley. Dr. Willner somehow sees them doing this and asks them to come have a meeting with him.
            Tom’s
            dad decides to take a long trip, away from Dr. Willner. All this time, Tom’s Dad knew what was going on, and
            decided to do something about it only at the end of the novel. This is an example of bad parenting.

            Overall, there are many things that the parents are doing wrong, and could have done something and decided
            to
            not contribute. There are many cases where the parents are brainwashed and don’t believe anything that their
            children say. Silas and Avery’s parents don’t believe anything their children say, which can cause bad
            things to
            happen to them when they become adults. Also, there are cases of where parents don’t realize what their
            children
            is doing, or even worse, know what they are doing about don’t stop them. Silas’s parents have this problem
            when
            they don’t stop Silas from doing drugs. Finally, there are cases where parents could have done something but
            didn’t do anything. Tom’s parents have a problem with this when there was a chance to stop Dr. Willner
            before
            anything got worse, but didn’t. The lack of parenting to the children in the novel could lead to depression
            and
            self-consciousness when they grow up and become adults.
