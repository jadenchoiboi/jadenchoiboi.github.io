            “From now on, you forget about gravity before you go through that door. The old gravity is gone, erased. Understand me? Whatever your gravity is when you get to the door, remember-the enemy’s gate is down.” (pg. 159). In the book, Ender’s Game by Orson Scott Card, the main protagonist, Ender Wiggin, lives in an era where aliens called “Buggers” and humans are at war, and the International Fleet think Ender should be the next commander to lead the 3rd Invasion. How do Ender’s settings change his attitude and behavior? This essay will show the changes Ender goes through when his settings; Earth (Home, School) battle school, command school, and how Ender changes when these settings change.

                Ender has a perfectly normal life, going to a normal school, and facing bullies and friends. Valentine, Ender’s caring and loving sister helps Ender with his problems and troubles. Peter, on the other hand, is a menacing and murderous brother that tortures Ender every chance he gets. On Earth, Ender acts civil. In his family of 2 adults and 3 children, Ender may have been the most civilized. Ender also promises himself on Earth that he will never become like Peter. One day, after he got his monitor - A monitor was something that was stuck to selected people’s backs for the army generals to monitor; after he got his monitor taken off him, Stiltson and a few of his friends went up to Ender and tried to beat him up. The regular Ender with the monitor would have treated this situation civilly instead of fighting, but Ender fights. Even when Stiltson is down, Ender keeps on fighting. “I am just like Peter. Take off my monitor and I am just like Peter.” (pg. 26). This shows the first sign of change, after Ender’s monitor is taken off. This is just the start of the journey of Ender’s change.

                The second setting where Ender shows major character change is at Battle School. Battle School is a gigantic starship in LEO (Low Earth Orbit) that is supposed to train intellectuals to see who could lead the fleet of the 3rd Invasion, against the buggers. The first instance where he shows change is his quarrel with Bernard. Benard is a kid in the same launch group as Ender who bothered ENder ceaselessly. Finally, Ender gets infuriated with him and snaps his arm. This behavior is not the behavior that Ender would have shown back on Earth. This behavior was the behavior of Peter. “I am just like Peter. I’m just like him. And Ender hated himself”. This quote shows Ender’s disbelief; how disappointed he is in himself. Back on Earth, he couldn't even dream of being like Peter and now he is at Battle School, using violence and breaking people’s body parts. The pressure of Battle School and the expectations placed on Ender that he had to be the best causes him to break from the civilized, calm human mask of himself and leads to a violent, cruel person.

                The major change Ender goes through is in Command School. Command School is where commanders like Ender go when they have excelled in commanding an army in Battle School. Command School is located on the asteroid Eros, where Ender is forced to lead the 3rd Invasion as the fleet’s captain. There, in Command School, he meets the legendary Mazer Rackham; the man famously known to have defeated the Buggers in the first invasion.  Ender is then brainwashed into leading the 3rd Invasion as part of his simulation and ends up killing the whole species of Buggers without knowing it. “I didn’t want to kill them all. I didn’t want to kill anybody! I’m not a killer! You didn’t want me, …, you wanted Peter, but you made me do it, you tricked me into it!” (pg. 262) This quote shows how Ender says that he wouldn’t have completely destroyed the species like Peter would have. Ender is mad at himself for being Peter; he wishes to be the calm, civil Earth self again. He then finds the queen of the buggers on Eros and takes it’s egg and tries to find a planet for them to live on to restore for what he had done.

                In conclusion, Ender changes drastically with the setting change of the novel. On Earth, he was the civil, calm, and nice person, but as pressure and influence covered him, he changed violent and cruel. My opinion on Ender is that even though he is smart, he should look at things a bit differently. When he comes to battle school, even if someone tries to sneak up on him, Ender tries to attack, but I feel like Ender could think over what he was going to do and look at things in the approacher’s perspective. I feel like this could help Ender keep the civil and smart self he was and not just use violence immediately to solve his problems.
