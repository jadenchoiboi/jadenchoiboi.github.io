        <h2>Characters: teacher, principal, jeffery</h2>
        <p>On a perfectly sunny Friday afternoon, Jeffery was stuck in the math classroom, writing a test that he had
            missed because of his Spring break. To ensure he didn’t do anything suspicious, the math teacher invited the
            principal to come watch. Everyone in the school had already left because of an early dismissal, so the
            school
            only had Jeffery, the math teacher, the principal. Suddenly, an alarm blared from downstairs. The math
            teacher
            and principal glanced at each other nervously. Jeffery asked what it was for, but they said “Oh don’t worry,
            it’s fine” but Jeffery knew it wasn't fine. In fact, he knew exactly what it was. He had seen the principal
            hang
            the alarm to warn the school if an intruder had walked in. The alarm on the second floor rang. They were on
            the
            6th floor. The principal whispered “Hide!”. They all hid in the closet that stored all the math exams.
            Inside the cabinets, the math teacher was having a mental breakdown. He was on his phone texting his wife
            goodbye, playing his last game of temple run, etc. The principal was curled up in a ball, whispering “Don’t
            let
            him come up to the 6th floor. I’m too young.” The alarm on the 6th floor rang. Jeffery could feel the
            goosebumps
            on his arms slowly rise as he could feel the vibration of footsteps as he could feel the person coming
            closer
            and closer to the math room. Now, the math teacher and principal were silently sobbing to themselves,
            repeating
            the phrases “Don’t let whoever that is find us.” Jeffery then used his critical thinking and formed a plan.
            He
            quickly told the principal “I have a plan. Please follow this as your lives may be depending on it…”.
            The plan itself was quite simple. They would put Jeffery’s phone in a shelf so the intruder would suspect
            the
            people to be in that cabinet, and while they were investigating, Jeffery, the math teacher, and the
            principal
            would run.</p>
        <p>The intruder was 2 rooms away, which was perfect timing to maneuver Operation Phone. Jeffery quickly set the
            alarm to default and put it in a random shelf. Then, the principal, the math teacher, and Jeff quickly ran
            to
            the nearest washroom and hid in one of the stalls. Jeffery could hear the alarm go off and the intruder
            running
            towards the math room. Jeffery quickly whispered “NOW” and the principal, the math teacher, and Jeffery
            quickly
            bolted for the stairs and ran faster than the speed of light. Once out, Jeffery quickly made a call to the
            police describing what had happened using the math teacher’s phone, since the principal and math teacher
            were
            too traumatized to move.</p>
        <br>
        The police came and did a quick search of the building, but came back empty handed. The intruder has been
        missing since, but has never came back to the school.
        <br>
        <br>
        This story shows that not just adults act in an adult way, and that children can act mature in certain
        situations.
