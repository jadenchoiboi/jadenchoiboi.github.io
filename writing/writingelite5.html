                In the book Percy Jackson by Rick Riordan, there is a demigod or halfblood named Percy that encounters many demons and monsters, but arrives at the sanctuary Camp Half Blood, where he and a few of his friends, Annabeth and Grover, Annabeth being a halfblood and Grover being a satyr, they go on a quest to find Zeus’s missing lightning bolt, and bring it back to Zeus before about 10 days. They meet many monsters along the way. Rick Riordan’s definition of a hero is to notice your flaws and changing them to improve yourself, and he decides to change Poseidon to make him more hero-like by changing his flaws, and Poseidon changes by being portrayed as noble and more god-like from the olden days, where he used to flip ships over and decrease the amount of fish the fisherman catch, and this portrayed Poseidon is a hero.

                The first example of him being a hero is the fact that Poseidon was much more cruel and mean in the myths, but in the book, he has changed to act more god-like and more heroic compared to the myths. In the greek myths, Poseidon is known to be easily offended. Poseidon wa also very competitive and was known to create many chaotic events. To get equal, Poseidon released sea monsters to get revenge on whoever offended him. He would also flip boats and destroy them at sea, and would make fisherman catch less fish and let them and their families starve. “A faint smile played on his lips, “Obedience does not come naturally to you, does it?” “ (pg. 345). This quote shows that Poseidon has changed a lot, since if anyone argued with Poseidon in the Greek Myths, he would shook the Earth, created big storms, caused massive earthquakes, and would have destroyed dozens of boats, but instead of that, he just smiles and says, “I must take some blame for that, I suppose. The sea does not like to be restrained.” (pg. 345). He takes blame for something instead of creating storms and unleashing sea monsters, and this shows that he has changed. This fits under Rick Riordan's definition of being a hero, which is finding flaws in yourself and trying to change those flaws.

                The second example of Poseidon changing is how he treats women. Even though Poseidon treated Medusa cruelly, there are examples in the book where he has changed from how he acted in the myths. In the book, Poseidon fell in love with Percy’s mom, and they agreed to marry since they both liked each other and nobody forced each other to marry each other, but in the myths, Poseidon forced his wife to marry him, even though she said “no” many times. Poseidon then sent his dolphins to kidnap her and bring her back to his palace, and then the wife of poseidon in the greek myth married Poseidon because she was fed up with Poseidon asking her. “Your mother is a queen among women,” Poseidon said wistfully. “I have not met a mortal woman in a thousand years.” (pg. 346). Poseidon and Percy’s mom liked each other equally, and had respect for each other, unlike in the myths, were Poseidon forced his wife to marry him, and this shows change.

                The third point is how the ocean is portrayed as Poseidon, and how the ocean is portrayed around the world. To most of the people in the world, the ocean is portrayed as a calm, peaceful place that people visit on holidays and sunny days. Since Poseidon is the sea god, he is portrayed as a calm, relaxed, and an easygoing person, but for the greeks, the ocean is portrayed the opposite of how people form different sides of the world think of it. The greeks think of the ocean as a way to see if Poseidon is mad at them. For example, if they caught little amounts of fish that day, the greek would think, “Why is Poseidon mad at me?”. If there were storms and floods on the land, the greek would think that they had made Poseidon enraged and would do anything to worship Poseidon to forgive them of whatever they did wrong. How Poseidon is portrayed here and there is different, and this shows change of how people view Poseidon and the sea.

                In conclusion, the sea god Poseidon has become a hero by seeing flaws in himself and changing the. For example, Poseidon was mean and evil in the myths, but in the story, found flaws in himself and changed all the flaws, and this makes Poseidon a hero. There are many differences between the book’s Poseidon and the myths Poseidon.
