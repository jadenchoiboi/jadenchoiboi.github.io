        Just as the popular proverb says that “one does not need to be great to do great deeds,” so too do Mother,
        Peter, Phyllis, and Bobbie in The Railway Children by E. Nesbit demonstrate how people don’t need to be
        outstanding to do great deeds. “Great” here means something that you do that you are content and proud of doing
        that makes a significant impact. In this essay, I will state 3 different examples of how Mother, Peter, Phyllis,
        and Bobbie make a great impact on people’s lives when they aren’t exceptionally talented or famous.

        The first great deed was when Mother made the decision to bring the Russian author home and provide him with
        sanctuary and food until he can continue on with this journey. This may not have a huge impact on the
        townspeople, but it had a huge impact in the Russian author’s heart and that is doing a great deed. Furthermore,
        most families wouldn’t even bother caring for the Russian man and would just ignore him, which shows how open
        minded and warm hearted Mother is. “Oh no,” mother said brightly, and she smiled. “I’m quite sure I’m not. Why,
        he’s a great man in his own country, writes books - I’ve read some of them, but I’ll tell you all about them
        tomorrow.” (pg. 96.) This quote connects with the quote “You don’t need to be great to do great deeds.”, because
        in this quote, it shows the good deed that she did and how much the Russian author was influenced by the care
        Mother gave him. This example also connects with the comprehension question “Actions are not important; what you
        mean by them is important.” Mother could have taken the Russian man home to get praising from other people, but
        on the other hand, she could have taken the Russian man home because she cared about him and wanted him to be
        safe. Both have the same kind action, but the intentions behind the first example and the second example are
        different, and this is what makes all the difference.


        The second great deed that Peter, Phyllis, and Bobbie did was when they made the decision to go inside the
        burning house and save the baby and the dog from the fire. The house was set on fire when the man was careless
        with his pipe and sparks flew on the ground, causing a fire. The children didn’t need to care at all; earlier
        that day, the owner of the house fought with Peter because he thought that Peter was fishing in his waterbank.
        These children weren’t firefighters, nevertheless the town master; they were only 10-12 year olds kids. They
        made the decision to go in and help the baby and help the dog stranded in the house. “Oh- how can you? Cried
        Phyllis. “Think of the poor dear dog.” “The baby!” screamed Bobbie. (pg. 152). These 3 children run into the
        house, risking their lives, to save a couple’s dogs and baby. This may not seem like a good deed since not a lot
        of people from the village knew about it, but it was in fact a good deed since it meant a lot for the owners of
        the house.


        The final example of when people that aren’t great do great things is when Bobbie, Peter, and Phyllis goes
        inside the train track to rescue a boy that they don’t even know. When the boy goes inside the tunnel, Bobbie
        decides to go to the end of the tunnel to great him at the end, but when he doesn’t show up, the children start
        to get worried. They go inside the train tracks to save a boy that they haven’t ever seen in their life. They
        had saved a person’s life. People were also there on the train tracks when the boy had gone in, but none of them
        took action about it. The new immigrants (Peter, bobbie, and Phyllis) are the ones that decide to take action
        and to find out what was wrong with the boy when he didn’t come out. “I’m going first,” said Peter; “it was my
        idea,”and he went. (pg. 212). What these kids are doing is the job of the post guards or the station master; or,
        these kids could have just gone off, ignoring the kid, but instead, they decide to help. Again, we can connect
        this example with the comprehension question “Actions are not important; what you mean by them is important.”
        This example connects with this sentence because they could have saved the stranded child just to get attention,
        but the children decided to help the boy not for attention, but because they were worried and they cared about
        the boy’s safety over the attention they would get.

        In conclusion, everyone can do a good deed. People don’t need to be as great as political leaders such as Nelson
        Mandela to do a good deed that influences people. A good deed can be so small that half the time you don’t
        realize you are doing a good deed. It can be as simple as saying thank you to someone that opens the door for
        you. The Railway Children demonstrates 3 kids that aren’t political leaders or famous that makes a big impact by
        doing simple things with good intentions. As the famous proverb states, “one does not need to be great to do
        great deeds”, you can see that it is true after all while reading this book.
