You and your friend are inseparable. From kindergarten, there has been an unbreakable bond between you. One day, in Grade 7, a new girl comes in; and both you and your friend fall in love with her. You suddenly find yourself competing with your friend, and arguing and sometimes even physically fighting with him, just to get your crush to like you more. In the play Romeo and Juliet by Shakespeare, we see many examples of characters doing violent deeds just for love. Despite the joy that loving creates for Romeo and Juliet, love can create violence and can lead to deadly consequences. This essay will show 3 examples of how love can create violence in the play; when Tybalt stabs Mercutio, how Romeo and Juliet kill themselves as soon as they find out that they are “dead”, and finally how Romeo kills Paris as he finds out that Paris is supposed to go out with Juliet.

        The first example of when love causes violence in the play is when Tybalt stabs Mercutio. Mercutio is a humorous, loyal friend of Romeo that gives him love advice and helps him get over his love for Rosaline. Mercutio isn’t in the family of Montague or the Capulet, but is a person that gets caught up in the drama between the family. However, one day, Tybalt comes in and declares that he wants to fight Romeo. Romeo tries to calm Tybalt down by saying “Tybalt, the reason that I have to love thee, Doth much excuse the appertaining rage, to such a greeting. Villain am I none. Therefore farewell. I see thou knowest me not.” (3.1.65). Romeo says this because Juliet and Tybalt are both Capulets, and if Romeo, a Montague, was going to go out with a Capulet, he was trying to love the Capulet family for him and Juliet to stay a married couple. However, hot tempered Mercuition gets in the way and gets stabbed and dies. A simple relationship and Romeo trying to love the Capulet family has definitely cause a lot of violence and tension between the two family members.

        Another example of love creating violence is when Romeo and Juliet kill themselves after they find out that both people are “dead”. One day, Balthasar brings news about Juliet being “dead”. This makes Romeo visit an apothecary, which then gives him poison. Romeo then visits Juliet with the poison. “Here’s to my love. O true apothecary, Thy drugs are quick. Thus with a kiss I die.” (5.3.120). In this quote, Romeo says that he is drinking the poison for his love to Juliet, and if Juliet is gone from the world, he will be gone also. What Romeo doesn’t realize is that Juliet is alive, and there is still blood flowing in her body. When Juliet wakes up, she also kills herself, knowing Romeo is dead. “To help me after! I will kiss thy lips. Haply some poison yet doth hang on them, To make me die with a restorative. (5.3.170). This quote shows that Juliet also loves Romeo and is willing to leave the mortal world with Romeo. THis is an example of how love creates violence, since a love relationship between Romeo and Juliet got so strong that they would kill each other for love.

The final example of love creating violence is when Romeo kills Paris after he comes face to face with him at Juliet’s tomb. Paris is a man that has been meaning to marry Juliet, and has asked Juliet’s parents if he could marry Juliet. Paris has gotten the approval of marrying Juliet and was supposed to marry her in a few days. Romeo, however, finds out that Paris will marry Juliet, and also finds Paris looking at Juliet in her tomb. “Wilt thou provoke me? Then have at thee, boy” (5.3.70). Romeo fights Paris, and eventually kills him by stabbing him with his sword. Since Romeo loves Juliet and Paris loves Juliet, Romeo is fighting for his love from Paris, which is supposed to marry Juliet in a few days.

        In conclusion, there are many examples of how love creates violence in this story. Romeo and Juliet’s love relationship creates many violent scenes and affects many people violently, like Mercutio and Paris. Even though love could create long term relationships and a loving feeling towards each other, love could just as easily create violence and have deadly consequences.
