        <h2>Notes 3: Images </h2>
        <li>
            <p>&lt;img&gt;</p>
            <p>This defines an Image on an HTML PAGE</p>
        <li>SRC: source <p>&lt;img&gt;</p>attributes</li>
        <p>This specifies the URL of an image</p>
        <li>There are two different ways to use this attribute</li>
        <p> First option: you can go on google and search for an image. After that, you double click on the image to
            find
            the options page. You find the SHORTENED link of the image there and put it in the image command to
            display your
            image on your website page. </p>
        <br>
        <p>Second option: you can save the image file. Save the image containing an HTML code in your finder. It
            will then
            pop up in your visual studio code on the very left. Put the link of the image in th image line and there
            you go.
        </p>
        <br>
        <li>The advantage of using the second method is that if the picture gets deleted off google, it will not
            show
            anymore in the code, but the second option will be permanent.</li>
        <p>HEIGHT AND WIDTH:<p>&lt;img&gt;</p>attribute </p>
        <li>This is used to resize the images in pixels. </li>
        <br>
        <p>you can only specify only one height and width and the aspect ratio will be adjusted </p>
